# Basic-Redux

This repository consists of implementation of Redux State Management from scratch where we will code step by step, the individual components using vanilla javascript and later on replacing those components with Redux. This is based off of Tyler Mcginnis's Redux course. There's a branch for each step of the implementation to see how I progressed from vanilla javascript to Redux.
